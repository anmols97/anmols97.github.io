            Iâ€™m a hands-on engineer with a product mindset. I value shipping fast without
            sacrificing quality. My focus areas include React, TypeScript, Node, cloud functions,
            and integrations with complex enterprise systems.

            This portfolio is designed to be clean and fast, with a Raycast-inspired aesthetic and
            keyboard-first UX.
